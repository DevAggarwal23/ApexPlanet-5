🚀 Capstone Project Completed – SkillSphere Web App! 🎯
I'm thrilled to share the final project of my internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd – a high-level, fully optimized web application built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🧠 Project Name: SkillSphere
🔗 Type: Capstone / Final Internship Project
⏱ Timeline: 9 Days
💻 Built With: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

🌐 What is SkillSphere?
SkillSphere is a modern, all-in-one developer portfolio web app that integrates multiple dynamic and interactive features in a single-page design using Glassmorphism UI and advanced frontend logic.

💡 Key Features Implemented:
✅ Typewriter Intro Animation – Personalized header to engage visitors dynamically.
✅ Dark Mode Toggle 🌙 – Smooth switch between light & dark themes using CSS variables.
✅ To-Do List App 📝 – Fully functional and responsive task manager with localStorage support to persist user data.
✅ Dynamic Project Showcase 🧩 – Project cards sorted by rating or name using real-time DOM updates.
✅ Glassmorphism UI Design ✨ – Transparent card layouts with backdrop blur for a polished modern interface.
✅ Fully Responsive Layout 📱 – Optimized for all screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries.
✅ Performance Optimized – Single-file implementation with inline minified styling and scripts to reduce load time and HTTP requests.
✅ Cross-Browser Compatible – Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge for consistency.

🎓 What I Learned:
🔹 End-to-end structure of a real-world web app
🔹 DOM manipulation and client-side data persistence
🔹 Modern UI/UX design trends (Glassmorphism, responsive design)
🔹 Optimization strategies (minifying, lazy rendering, clean structure)
🔹 Building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly frontend systems

I’m incredibly thankful to the mentors and team at ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd for this hands-on opportunity and support. This internship helped transform my theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world skills.
